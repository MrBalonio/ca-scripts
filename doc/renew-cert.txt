NAME
        renew-cert.sh - renew a previously generated cert for another year

SYNOPSIS
        renew-cert.sh /path/to/certificate
        renew-cert.sh <hostname>
        renew-cert.sh <username>

DESCRIPTION
        This script renews a certificate for another 365 days from it's current
        end-date. It does some interesting hackery to re-sign the certificate
        request generated when the certificate was initially signed, using the
        same key-pair and the same serial, so that S/MIME encrypted e-mail and
        previously signed code does not become unusable.

OPTIONS
        This script takes no options.
